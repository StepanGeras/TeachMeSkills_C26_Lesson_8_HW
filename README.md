Lesson_8

Create a program to simulate the work of a clinic.
Let there be three doctors in the clinic: a surgeon, a therapist and a dentist.
Every doctor has a method of “treating,” but every doctor treats differently.
Also provide a “Patient” class with a “Treatment Plan” field and a “Doctor” field.
Create an object of the “Patient” class and add a treatment plan to the patient.
The therapist will create a method that will prescribe a doctor to the patient according to the plan
treatment:
If the treatment plan has code 1, appoint a surgeon and perform the treatment method.
If the treatment plan has code 2, appoint a dentist and perform the treatment method.
If the treatment plan has any other code, assign a therapist and perform the method
treat.
